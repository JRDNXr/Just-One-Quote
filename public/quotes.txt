Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The best confidence builder is experience.
Most powerful is he who controls his own power.
A soldier’s most powerful weapon is courage.
Strength of character can defeat strength in numbers.
The strong survive, the noble overcome.
Where there’s a will, there’s a way.
Facing all that you fear will free you from yourself.
With great power comes great responsibility.
If you're lonely when you're alone, you're in bad company.
Everything is a dangerous drug except reality; which is unendurable.
The last cloth you wear has no pockets.
People are with you for a reason, a season, or a lifetime. You just don't know which.|Brian A. Chalker
